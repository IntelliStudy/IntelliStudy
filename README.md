## Legal Issues

Data Privacy

- IntelliStudy collects and analyzes user notes, including class notes, and some class notes could be considered property of the professor or university, so there might be legal issues for misuse of property

## Social Issues

Ethical use at School

- IntelliStudy could be used during closed-book exams when not allowed by professors, which is allows for unethical use of the application

## Anticipated Risks

- Higher complexity than initially expected
- Issues integrating different components of application together (eg: frontend and backend)
- Accuracy of AI Analysis
- Conducting enough testing and gaining insightful user feedback
- Educational content variability since class notes and evaluation formats can vary significantly across courses.

## Initial plans for first release

- Presentation of prototype with limited features at the end of 4910.
- Presentation and demo of finalized product at the end of 4911.
